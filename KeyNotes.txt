This is a key text file with infomation on notes to remind me on what I did.

#1: When using tailwind check the latest one because it changing on how to install tailwind into your code.
    Terminal 1:
    - when looking it up I got > - npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cli postcss autoprefixer -
    - use this to watch it create/go - npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/tailwind.css --watch - 

#2: To run the code if local file.
    Terminal 2:
    - use npm run dev
    - will make a localhost that will auto generate when working in it.

#3: Each component or files getting called must be imported from the App.jsx
    - goes by the name and then the location that the name is from.
